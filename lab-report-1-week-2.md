# Lab 1 - Remote Access
## Part 1 - Installing Visual Studio Code
To install Visual Studio Code, we simply need to follow these steps: <br>
1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) website and download the application for your operating system.
2. After unzipping the download file, open the Visual Studio Code application and follow the steps for setup.

After finishing setup, you should see a window similar to this (some details may be different depending on your settings):

## Part 2 - Remotely Connecting
For Window users only: [Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

To connect to the server, you need your course-specific account. Look that up [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).

Then, to connect to the remote server, we are going to use Visual Studio Code's terminal. Open the terminal by navigating to Terminal -> New Terminal or an equivalent keyboard shortcut.

Enter the following command to initiate the connection (replace apy with letters in your course-specific account): <br>
`$ ssh cs15lsp22apy@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
